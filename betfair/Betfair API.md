5.Exchange Stream API - allows you to subscribe to market changes (both price and definitions) and orders.


## Operations (Betting api)
* listEventTypes - List different sports etc to bet on.
* listCompetitions - Champions League, US open etc
* listTimeRanges - Date intervals whith bets 
* listEvents - specific games. Some team names are abbreviations! Has start date and time
* listMarketTypes - Type of bets
* listCountries - Countries
* listVenues - Venue
* listMarketCatalogue - Get hold of the marketId of specific events
* listMarketBook - Probably returns price data etc. Call using market id returned by listMarketCatalogue
* listRunnerBook - ???
* placeOrders -

### Possible approach:
1. Use listMarketType to see which types of bets are available.
2. Select the bet types that can be used together
3. Take one set of bets that go together. Use them in the marketfilter
4. Use ListEvents to find games to play on
5. Use listMarketCatalogue with the specific eventIds to get marketIds. Set maxResults to be higher than 1!
6. Use listMarketBook to get the odds of all marketIds that were received
7. Check all odds for every bet type for a specific game (what endpoint???), see if there is an arbitrage possibility.
8. Do this by combining with competitors of betfair also.

## Operations (Accounts API)
* createDeveloperAppKeys
* getDeveloperAppKeys

### Questions
* How do we get a specific bet/odds for a game? listEvents only say the game, not the bet type or the odds!
